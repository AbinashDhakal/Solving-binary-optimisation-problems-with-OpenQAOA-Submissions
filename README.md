# Solving-binary-optimisation-problems-with-OpenQAOA-Submissions

Welcome to the 2023 Bootcamp's challenge! This challenge was sponsored by Entropica labs and will introduce you to their Open-source multi-backend Software Development Kit. In order to submit your solutions, please create a pull request adding a folder with your relevant documentation to this repository. If you need any assistance with how to do this, please reach out to the event organizers (we'll be in 8W 2.5 around the clock). 
I have added a list of resources and links that may be of use to you below.
Good luck!
